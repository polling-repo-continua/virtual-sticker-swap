<h1>How to play #virtualstickerswap...</h1>
	<p>2020 has seen some pretty weird shifts in the conference scene, and while virtual cons are doing a great job of keeping us all connected and up-to-speed, the con blues are real. <b>#virtualstickswap</b> is to help encourage folks to share the swag AND the love, to stay connected, and to create some conference-like excitement as we all weather the various stages of lockdown.</p>
<h2>Here's to start a #virtalstickerswap</h2>
	<ul>Gather enough stickers from your collection to share a couple with three people. Duplicates are awesome. If you're a sticker producer, LOT'S of duplicates are awesome.</ul>
	<ul>Wash your hands... ;)</ul>
	<ul>Write your Twitter @handle on a slip of paper along with the address for this website.</ul>
	<ul>Get your loot and your slip together, take a photo, tweet it with the hashtag #virtualstickerswap.</ul>
	<ul>Put everything into an envelope along with two more prepaid envelopes or stamps... (These to encourage your recipient to pay it forward by making it a bit easier for them.)</ul>
	<ul>Send it along to someone who'll pay it forward!!!</ul>
<h2>Received loot? Here's what's next...</h2>
	<ul>Take what you'd like from your package.</ul>
	<ul>Replenish what you've taken with stickers from your own collection. If you don't have much to share that's OK: Just don't be greedy - This is about paying it forward :)</ul>
	<ul>Add your Twitter handle to the list, take a pic, and Tweet it with the #virtualstickerswap hastag.</ul>
	<ul>Divide the loot into the two prepaid envelopes, pop in another two prepaid envelopes or stamps of your own, and...</ul>
	<ul>Send it along to someone who'll pay it forward!!!</ul>
<h2>That's it! Have fun, stay safe, and let's see how far this can go.</h2>
